As a reader, I want to:
- choose a story genre to find stories that I enjoy
- make in-story choices to shape the narrative
- save my progress to continue later
- see my story history to revisit past choices
- share completed stories with friends

As a new user, I want to:
- Create an account to save my progress
- Browse available genres before starting
- get a tutorial on how choices work
